## Database Schema Documentation
The `schema.sql` file is designed to be used with PostgreSQL as the primary database system. It leverages PostgreSQL-specific features to optimize performance and maintainability. However, the file is modular and can be modified to support other database systems with minimal adjustments.

### Compatibility
- **Primary Target**: PostgreSQL.
- **Adaptability**: Can be tailored for MySQL, SQLite, or other SQL-based databases by adjusting syntax and features.

This flexibility ensures that the schema can be adapted to various environments while maintaining its core functionality.

The `schema.sql` file is a crucial component of the database setup. It contains the SQL commands necessary to define the structure of the database, including:

- **Tables**: Specifies the tables and their columns.
- **Relationships**: Defines how tables are linked through foreign keys.
- **Constraints**: Ensures data integrity with primary keys, unique constraints, and more.

This file serves as the blueprint for creating and maintaining the database, ensuring consistency and scalability.

### Key Features
- **Modular Design**: Organized for readability and maintainability.
- **Scalability**: Designed to accommodate future changes.
- **Standards-Compliant**: Follows SQL best practices.

To apply the schema using PostgreSQL, run:
```bash
psql -U <username> -d <database_name> -f schema.sql
```
