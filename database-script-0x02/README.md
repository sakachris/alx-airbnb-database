## Seed.sql Overview

The `seed.sql` script is designed to populate the database with initial data, making it easier to test and develop the application. It contains a set of SQL statements that insert predefined records into the database tables.

### Key Features
- **Predefined Data**: Includes sample data for quick setup and testing.
- **PostgreSQL Compatibility**: The script is specifically prepared to be used with a PostgreSQL database.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies the process of initializing the database with meaningful data.

### Usage
To execute the `seed.sql` script, ensure you have a PostgreSQL database set up and accessible. Then, run the following command:

```bash
psql -U <username> -d <database_name> -f seed.sql
```

Replace `<username>` with the PostgreSQL username and `<database_name>` with the name of the database.

### Notes
- Ensure that the database schema is already created before running the script.
- Review the script to understand the data being inserted and modify it if necessary to suit the application's needs.
